            <h3>Camera</h3>
            <p>The MacBook Pro features a built-in webcam located above the display, allowing users to engage in video calls, capture photos and videos, and interact with camera-dependent applications. Webcam quality varies across models, with newer iterations boasting higher resolutions and enhanced image processing. Users can manage camera permissions and settings through macOS's System Preferences, while privacy features like physical camera covers or indicator lights help protect against unauthorized access. The webcam's compatibility extends to a range of third-party applications, providing versatility in its usage.</p>
